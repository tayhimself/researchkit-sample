# ResearchKit Sample Project
### From https://github.com/vishnuravi/ResearchKit-Sample
I didn't branch becuase this repo is going to be me breaking things to see how they work. Going to see how to integrate SwiftUI and UIKit along with CareKit.

### Install
- I didn't use the normal way to install ResearchKit becuase this project uses Swift Cocoapods. 
- I had an old Ruby install which fucked up the pod installer and I had to reset system Ruby to a new version using brew.
